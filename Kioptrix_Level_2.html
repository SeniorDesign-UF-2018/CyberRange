        <h3>Phase 1 Recon: Collecting information about the target</h3>
        <p>Get our <span class="red-highlight">IP</span> by using <span class="blue-highlight">ifconfig</span>, and then
           use <span class="blue-highlight">nmap</span> to scan the range of possible IP's.</p>
        <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic1.png" height="400" width="900">
        <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic2.png" height="400" width="900">
        <p> We can see now that the target IP is: 192.168.232.134</p>

        <h3>Phase 2 Scanning: Discover OS, open ports, and running services</h3>
        <p>Now we can use <span class="blue-highlight">nmap</span> to scan the open ports on our target. Sometimes the
          -A tool can produce an overwhelming amount of results, so this time we will use <span class="blue-highlight">nmap -A</span>
           (all information) <span class="blue-highlight">-p</span> (ports) <span class="blue-highlight">[ip]</span> to specify which
           ports we want to get our information from. We are listingall of the ports found in the initial scan.</p>

        <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic3.png" height="400" width="900">
        <p>Now we see the open <span class="red-highlight">ports</span>, the services that they are running, and the operating system. We know the:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open Ports</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Port 22: <span class="red-highlight">Secure Shell</span> for remote access to the terminal</li>
            <li>Port 80: Standard port used for web servers, this one is running an <span class="red-highlight">Apache</span> web server v. 1.3.20</li>
            <li>Port 111: Used for <span class="red-highlight">rpcbind</span>, a utility that maps remote procedure calls(RPCs) to their corresponding addresses onthe server in order to carry out function calls.</li>
            <li>Port 443: This is another port serving a webpage with the same informationas port 80</li>
            <li>Port 631: <span class="red-highlight">CUPS</span> (Common UNIX Printing System) allows a system to act like a print server, accepting jobs and sending them to the correct printer, using Internet Printing Protocol (<span class="red-highlight">ipp</span>).</li>
            <li>Port 3306: <span class="red-highlight">MySQL</span> is an open source database system used on webpages and servers. It uses <span class="red-highlight">SQL</span>, a standard database language, for management of the database.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Operating System</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The machine is running a version of Linux 2.6x</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

          <h3>Phase 3 Enumeration:  A more active way of gathering information</h3>
          <p>We will now be connecting to potentially vulnerable ports to gather more information about our target machine.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Port 80: HTTP/WEB<li>
          </ul>
          <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic4.png" height="400" width="900">
          <p>The webpage is serving a login page. Since we know that the machine is also running a MySQL server its is likely that we can use a technique called
            <span class="red-highlight">SQL Injection</span> to get a successful login. SQL Injection works much like the <span class="red-highlight">command line injection</span> introduced in the <span class="green-highlight">Rickdiculously Easy VM</span>, making
            it possible to inject our own SQL commands to the server. SQL works by retrieving records in the database that match the information entered. We can use a statement that in SQL syntax always returns true, to make it seem like we’ve entered the correct password.
            Therefore by using Username = test (we can use ANY username we like) and Password = ‘ or ‘1’=’1 in the password, we are able to login to the page. The first apostrophe ‘  ends the statement, then using SQL specific syntax <span class="red-highlight">or '1' = '1</span>, to say
            that the password is true. This allows us to login to the page, which redirects us to this page.</p>
          <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic5.png" height="400" width="900">
          <p>This is a simple page that <span class="red-highlight">pings</span>, sends information (packets), to a specific IP to make sure that the IP can receive and accept requests. Let’s ping ourselves to see what’s happening.</p>
          <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic6.png" height="400" width="900">
          <p>So we can see that the machine is pinging our target machine. Let’s try some <span class="red-highlight">command line injection<span> to see if we can get the target to execute our code. Using <span class="blue-highlight">; cat /etc/passwd<span> we were able to get the passwd file, but using <span class="blue-highlight">; cat /etc/shadow</span> we are unable to get the shadow file.</p>
          <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic7.png" height="400" width="900">
          <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic8.png" height="400" width="900">
          <p>Lets try setting up a <span class="red-highlight">reverse shell</span> using the same technique from <span class="green-highlight">Kioptrix Level 1.</span></p>
          <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic9.png" height="400" width="900">
          <p>So we effectively set up a listener from our attack machine and connected to it from our target using bash. Now that we are in lets check to see what user we are logged in as using <span class="blue-highlight">whoami</span>.</p>
          <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic10.png" height="400" width="900">
          <p>Well we aren’t root, but since we are in the system lets see if there are any <span class="red-highlight">Privilege Escalation Exploits</span> that we can use. Using what we know about the operating system I used Searchsploit to see if I could find something, however the results for <span class="blue-highlight">searchsploit Linux 2.6 local</span> were overwhelming. Lets narrow down
            our search and see if what version we are running using the <span class="blue-highlight">uname</span> command and the <span class="blue-highlight">-a</span> flag to get the kernel version.</p>
          <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic11.png" height="400" width="900">
          <p>Since the searchsploit results were too plentiful, lets try google, to include more search terms.</p>
          <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic12.png" height="400" width="900">
          <p>The first page that came up looked promising.</p>
          <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic13.png" height="400" width="900">
          <p>Lets try this on our target. We can download this exploit to the target from our shell using <span class="blue-highlight">wget</span>. I moved to the tmp directory but it can be downloaded into any file.</p>
          <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic14.png" height="400" width="900">
          <p>Before we can compile the file we need to change its name, which we can do using the mv command, to include the .c file extension.</p>
          <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic15.png" height="400" width="900">
          <p>Lets run it!</p>
          <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic16.png" height="400" width="900">
          <p>Again checking our status using <span class="blue-highlight">whoami</span>, we see that we have root. To establish <span class="red-highlight">persistence</span>, we can use the useradd command like in the previous level. This time we cannot execute it from anywhere using the ./usr/sbin/useradd, but by simply navigating to the file cd <span class="blue-highlight">~/usr/sbin</span>  (~ meaning root) we can execute ./useradd like before.</p>
          <img src="./images/Kioptrix_Level_2/pic17.png" height="400" width="900">
          <p>Now we can log in anytime we want with root privileges.</p>
